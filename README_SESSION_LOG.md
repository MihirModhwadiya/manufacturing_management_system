## Recent Errors & Debugging

### 1. Backend Import Error
**Error:**
```
SyntaxError: The requested module '../middleware/auth.js' does not provide an export named 'auth'
```
**Cause:**
- The backend route `inventory.js` was importing `auth` and `authorize` instead of the correct `authenticateToken` and `authorizeRoles` from the middleware.

**Resolution:**
- Updated all imports and route handlers to use the correct middleware names.

### 2. Login Failing
**Symptoms:**
- Login attempts from the frontend fail.
- No specific error message provided.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
- Verified frontend is sending correct credentials to `/api/auth/login`.
- Checked backend for user existence, active status, and verification.
- Advised to check backend logs for error messages and ensure user is verified and active.

---

## Server Status
- Both frontend and backend servers are running successfully.
- Health endpoint tested: `curl http://localhost:5000/api/health`
- No critical runtime errors after fixing middleware imports.

---

## Recommendations
- If login fails, check backend logs for error details.
- Ensure user accounts are active and verified in the database.
- For further debugging, provide the exact error message shown on login.

---

## Conversation Log (Summary)
- Implemented advanced inventory features and completed all major modules.
- Debugged backend import errors and fixed middleware usage.
